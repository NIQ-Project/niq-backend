# Pitch
users can sign up and make a monthly bucket list and add and check off task or events they complete.

# Project Goals
Our goals for this project is to work as an agile team and work together to problem solve code and bugs for our app that helps people keep track of their bucket list. We will also be using post man to set up our backEnd api calls 

# Documentation
Create 2 Github repos (one for your front-end and one for your back-end)
 Pin both repositories on GitHub as a Popular Repository
Both front-end and back-end repos should include README's with:

# tech used
we will be using html, css, bootstrap, react, mongoose, and JSX

# ERD
A user has a many list and the list has many items.
